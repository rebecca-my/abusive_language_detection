**Abusive Language Detection**

The examination presented here replicates a portion of Waseem and Hovy's investigation of abusive language. In their examination, the authors create a corpus of abusive tweets. To increase the number tweets represented in the corpus the authors searched for topics that attracted racist and sexist language, including political topics, sports, and religion.  The results of their examination demonstrated that character n-grams and gender performed best when trying to classify abusive tweets using a logistic regression classifier. Our examination uses the same corpus to train a logistic regression classifier and, to the best of our ability, replicate Waseem and Hovy's examination. 
A full explanation of the methods for abusive language classification and findings are reported in, [ReplicatingWaseem Hovyâ€™s examination of abusive language.](https://github.com/rebecca-my/abusive_language_detection/blob/main/Replicating_Waseem_Hovy_examination_of_abusive_language.pdf)
